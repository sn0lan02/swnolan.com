        <h3 id="tpi-experience">Tolmar Pharmaceutical Inc</h3>
        <p>As an FP&A intern at Tolmar, I was responsible for management financial reports and making sure that management was getting the most accurate and necessary financial information they needed to effectively run the company. One of the largest projects I was on during my time at Tolmar was the Latest best estimate forecast for Q3 and Q4 of 2023 and 2024. This project required our team to put together financial reports on the health of Tolmar and where we estimate the company is headed in the future</p>
        <p>This was a summer role from May to August 2023 that I again worked the next year in 2024 </p>

Our team was able to raise ~$83,000 for the charity and sponsor site building times for the construction of a home.
