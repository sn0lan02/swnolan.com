## about the website and project
The goal of this project is to create a professional website showcasing my professional skills and to share a bit of info about me. So far, the website runs using a domain name purchased from the DNS site Namecheap labeled swnolan.com. Because it is hosted by github pages, when entering the domain into a web browser, it redirects the user to https://sn0lan02.github.io/swnolan.com/
